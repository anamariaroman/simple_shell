### Description

A shell is a microprocessor that executes commands every time the user commands it. A linux shell is both a command interpreter as well as a programming language that exposes all the services of the operating system to a user or another program with the help of a command line interface.

### Requirements

- Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

## Compilation

Your shell will be compiled this way:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
